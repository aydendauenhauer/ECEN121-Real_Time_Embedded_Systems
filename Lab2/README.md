This repository contains my Lab 2 project for ECEN 121, where I used STM32CubeMX and Keil to generate and configure STM32L476 projects, create “blinky light” LED code, optimize the chip’s pin and clock settings, and reuse the MX configuration while writing a simple C main.c that performs basic arithmetic and runs in an infinite loop. The repository includes the written lab report.
