This repository contains my Lab 3 project for ECEN 121, where I controlled an addressable LED strip from the STM32L476 Discovery board. In this lab I configured GPIO pins on port E for software-driven SPI, wrote C routines (spi32 and sendarray) to shift out 32-bit color frames to each LED, and created animations by updating a buffer so a lit LED moves along the strip; an extra-credit version cycles through multiple colors. The repository includes the written lab report.
