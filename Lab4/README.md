This repository contains my Lab 4 project for ECEN 121, where I configured external interrupts and timers on the STM32L476 Discovery board to control the LEDs and on-board LCD. The lab sets up joystick EXTI handlers to toggle LEDs, then adds display.c and timer interrupt code so joystick presses can start, stop, reset, and display an “X” or a running stopwatch-style timer on the segmented LCD. The repository includes the written lab report.
