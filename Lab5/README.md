This repository contains my Lab 5 project for ECEN 121, where I implemented concurrency and buffer management on the STM32L476 Discovery board. Using timers, external interrupts, and shared global variables, the lab builds a circular buffer that is filled in timer ISRs while a separate snapshot buffer is captured either via a higher-priority joystick interrupt or by temporarily disabling interrupts in main() to avoid race conditions. The repository includes the written lab report.
