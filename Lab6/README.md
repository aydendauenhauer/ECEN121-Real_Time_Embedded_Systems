This repository contains my Lab 6 project for ECEN 121, where I implemented an infrared remote-control interface on the STM32L476 Discovery board. The lab uses a Timer 7 interrupt to sample the IR receiver signal into a buffer, decodes the pulse widths into a 32-bit code in parseIRCode, and then responds to specific NEC-style hex values by toggling LEDs or displaying text messages on the LCD glass display. The repository includes the written lab report.
