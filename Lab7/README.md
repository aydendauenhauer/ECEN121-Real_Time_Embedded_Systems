This repository contains my Lab 7 project for ECEN 121, where I configured the STM32L476 Discovery board as a USB HID host for a mouse and used the mouse motion and button presses to control the position and color of a moving “spot” on an addressable LED strip. The lab explores the ST USB host stack by examining functions such as USBH_HID_SOFProcess, USBH_UsrLog, and fixData, extracting the mouse’s Vendor/Product IDs, and mapping left, right, and middle clicks to different LED colors while tuning sensitivity with the SPOTFRAC constant.
