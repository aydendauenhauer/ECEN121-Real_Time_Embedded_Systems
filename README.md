# ECEN121-Real_Time_Embedded_Systems
This repository contains my ECEN 121 – Real-Time Embedded Systems lab, implemented primarily in C. The goal of these labs is to practice key real-time and embedded software concepts, including multitasking, scheduling, interrupt-driven I/O, synchronization, peripheral drivers, and buffered communication with external devices. The repository includes source files for the lab implementations as well as any helper modules, header files, and supporting documentation. This project is shared for personal reference and portfolio purposes only. If you are currently enrolled in ECEN 121, please do not copy this work or submit it as your own. Follow SCU’s academic integrity policies.
